# mcOS BS Inline Battery
ðŸ”‹ This is a fork of Kelvin Zhang's original Mac OSX Inline Battery.

Subtle changes that makes a big difference.
I have made small modifications to make the battery icon look like the new macOS Big Sur, with its corners a little more rounded than the classic version of macOS.
I hope you like it and enjoy this new look at the battery icon on your top panel.
